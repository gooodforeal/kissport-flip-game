EXPLANATION (Y OR N)? 
ON EACH TURN, YOU GUESS YES <'Y'> OR NO <'N'>.
ONLY ONE IS CORRECT, AND THE PROGRAM HAS DECIDED
WHICH ONE, BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR GUESS. AT FIRST
YOUR ODDS ARE 50%, PURE CHANCE. BUT LATER THE
PROGRAM WILL TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PATTERNS
IN YOUR GUESSING.


GAME ENDS AFTER 50 TURNS; A SCORE OF 24 OR MORE
IS GOOD. PROGRAM TELLS WHEN YOU WIN A TURN,
BY TYPING AN ASTERISK ('*') AS THE FIRST
CHARACTER OF THE FOLLOWING LINE.
